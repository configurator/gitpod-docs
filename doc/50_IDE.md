# Theia - Gitpod's IDE

The IDE in Gitpod is based on the open-source project [Theia](https://theia-ide.org). It is hosted and developed under the umbrella of the Eclipse Foundation, which ensures vendor neutrality 
and emphasizes diversity.

## Overview

When first opened you will see a welcome screen, that briefly gives you the most important pointers to get started. After closing it you will
see the workbench shell. Depending on the [context URL](30_Workspaces.md#context-urls) different views might be opened. 

Let's have a look at the primary elements we see.

### Views and Editors

A Theia workbench shell consists of any numbers of opened views and editors. 
Views and editors can be freely arranged by dragging and dropping them around. 

### Main Area and Panels

Within the main area, the drag and drop functionality allows to split freely as you will. Also widgets can be moved 
to the side or bottom panels.
