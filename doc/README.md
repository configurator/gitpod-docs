# Gitpod Documentation

[Gitpod](https://www.gitpod.io) is an online IDE, that integrates with code hosting platforms such as GitHub, 
GitLab and Bitbucket. With a single click it creates ready-to use developer workspaces with a fully-featured 
IDE running in the Cloud.

In contrast to traditional cloud and desktop IDEs, Gitpod understands the context and prepares the IDE accordingly.
For instance, if your are creating a Gitpod workspace from a GitHub Pull Request, the IDE will open in code review mode.

Also, Gitpod workspaces are meant to be disposable. that is you don't need to maintain anything. They are created when you need them
but you can forget about them if you are done. Simply go to GitHub and create a fresh workspace whenever you need one.

The IDE is open-source and based on [Eclipse Theia](50_IDE.md). Theia is highly extensible and builds
upon mature technologies such as TypeScript, VS Code, Webpack, and Node.js. 

This site provides all the details on how to use Gitpod and Theia.
